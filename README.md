## Greedy Mod Development

### Why Develop Greedy Mods?

- **Selective Inclusion**: Your mod only needs to include what you changed about a particular source file (eg add a new property, delete a property, or add an array element), _drastically_ reducing the risk of collisions between mods.
- **Patch Merge**: Intelligent merging of files, allowing automated merge even within the same file.
- **Inheritance**: You can use one file as a base for another.
- **Conditional Export**: You can configure your mod to export the same file multiple ways depending on which mods are installed.
- **Dependency Autoinstall**: Users can automatically install your mod's dependencies.
- **Automated Updates**: Users can update to the latest version of your mod automatically.
- **Comments**: You can add C-style comments to your source files.
- **Reduced Boilerplate**: Fractional files and inheritance reduces the effort required to make small mods
- **Improved Exposure**: Greed comes with a catalog of online mods that can be automatically installed.
- **File Diff**: Greed ships with a diff tool specifically for Sins II data files, allowing you to readily see exactly what you've done.

### Merge Types

The ultimate goal of Greed is to allow multiple mods to gracefully integrate together so that we can release smaller, more targeted mods, rather than these massive bundles that nobody really knows what's inside them. To facilitate this, Greed acts as an arbiter, compiling greedy mods into a single "mod" in the mods directory which is then listed as active for Sins II to read from.

Ideally, a mod should change **_as little as it can_** to have its desired effect so that multiple mods could even modify the same file.

#### Greed Merge Extensions

To that end, Greed introduces several json file extensions that allow targeted edits within a given file. For example, if you want to edit the Kol, you might name your file `trader_battle_capital_ship.unit.gmr`.

- `.gmr` **(Greed Merge Replace)**: for each element in the the mod file's arrays, it replaces the greed file's corresponding element at that index, per **Newtonsoft**'s `MergeArrayHandling.Replace`.
    - eg `[1, 2, 3]` + `[4, 5]` = `[4, 5, 3]`
    - [Example](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/constituent-components/blob/master/entities/trader_heavy_gauss_slugs.unit_item.gmr) removing an element from an array
- `.gmc` **(Greed Merge Concatenate)**: for each element in the mod's array, it concatenates them onto the original array, per **Newtonsoft**'s `MergeArrayHandling.Concat`.
    - eg `[1, 2]` + `[2, 3]` = `[1, 2, 2, 3]`
    - [Example](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/constituent-components/blob/master/entities/buff.entity_manifest.gmc) of adding elements to an entity_manifest
- `.gmu` **(Greed Merge Union)**: for each element in the mod's array that does not already exist in the original array, add it to the end of the array, per **Newtonsoft**'s `MergeArrayHandling.Union`.
    - eg `[1, 2]` + `[2, 3]` = `[1, 2, 3]`
    - [Example](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/constituent-components/blob/master/entities/trader_antimatter_engine_unit_item.ability.gmu) of adding autocast

In all of these cases, if you leave an object's field undefined, it will not be edited. So, if you wanted to edit just one of the many arrays in a `.player` file to add a new ship type, you'd only declare the one array you want to edit, and you'd probably do it in a `.gmu` file so you can add what you want to what's already there without redeclaring everything or worrying about another mod colliding with yours.

#### Null Removal

- If a field within your mod is null (not undefined, but actually `null`), it will **delete** that field from the greed file under construction. 
    - This applies regardless of whether you are using a `.gm*` file type or not.
- If inside an array in a `*.gmr`, it will delete the element at that original index from an array.
    - For example, in the array `[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]`, if you want to remove the middle two elements, your mod would have `[ 1, null, null ]`, which would result in `[ 1, 4 ]`.

[Example](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/constituent-components/blob/master/entities/trader_reserve_squadron_hangar.unit_item.gmr) removing a field from an item

> _**Note**: be very careful when removing elements by index that you know **_exactly_** what is there already._

### Greedy File Object Schema

Inside json source files, you can have a top-level object to define additional rules, as seen [here](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/capital-starts/blob/main/entities/vasari_rebel_battle.player.gmr) or in [these files](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/alias-test/tree/main/localized_text).

| Field | Type | Description | Default Value |
|:------|:-----|:------------|:--------------|
| `parent` | `string` | The file name of the file you wish to inherit from. A file with a parent will prefer to initialize from the parent file instead of from its own the gold file (if one even exists). The parent can be a gold file, a file created by your mod, or a file created by another mod. It must be in the same directory with the same type. For example, the above was in a `.player` file in the `entities/` directory, so the parent file should be as well. | `null` |
| `alias` | `string` | By default, a greedy file will export with its own name (eg `a.buff.gmr` produces `a.buff`), but if alias is specified, it allows you to control what the output filename will be. | \<filename\> |
| `exportOrder` | `int` | Files are exported by the following hierarchical ascending sort:<br/><ol><li>Mod Export Order</li><li>Folder</li><li>Export Name</li><li>File Export Order</li><li>Lexicographically</li></ol> | 0 |
| `prerequisites` | `string[]` | Only export this file if the provided mods are **all** installed and active. | `[]` |
| `mode` | `string` | Allows in-file specification of the greed merge type, eg `gmr`. | \<extension\> |
| `mutations` | `mutation[]` | _This feature is WIP and will be documented once complete._ | `[]` |

#### GFOS Example

```json
{
    "greed": {
        "parent": "my_parent_file",
        "alias": "actual_export_file",
        "exportOrder": 2,
        "prerequisites": ["other-mod"],
        "mode": "gmr",
        "mutations": []
    }
}
```

### Greed Configuration

To make a mod compatible with Greed, you need only add a `greed.json` file to your mod's folder, as seen below.

```json
{
    "name": "Your Mod",
    "author": "Your Name",
    "url": "https://github.com/YourName/your-mod",
    "description": "Blurb goes here.",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "sinsVersion": "1.15.1.0",
    "greedVersion": "1.7.2",
    "dependencies": [
        {
            "id": "other-mod",
            "version": "1.0.0"
        }
    ],
    "predecessors": [
        "pred-mod"
    ]
    "conflicts": ["conflicting-mod"],
    "isTotalConversion": false
}
```

While I recommend you take advantage of Greed's more powerful features like merge file extensions, merely adding the above will make any mod interactible for Greed.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| `name`* | `string` | The human-readable name of your mod |
| `author`* | `string` | Who you are. |
| `description`* | `string` | A brief summary of your mod. Save details for the readme. |
| `url`* | `url` | The URL to your thread or repo where you give greater details about your mod. Details beyond what is covered in the description should be covered here, as well as the means to contact you with bugs. |
| `version`* | `version` | The version of the mod itself. If contributing to the catalog, this MUST match the version there. |
| `sinsVersion`* | `version` | The minimum compatible Sins version. |
| `greedVersion`* | `version` | The minimum compatible Greed version. |
| `dependencies`* | `dependency[]` | An array of dependencies that are REQUIRED for this mod to function. |
| `predecessors`* | `string[]` | An array of mods that if this is co-active with SHOULD be loaded first. |
| `conflicts`* | `string[]` | An array of mod ids with which this mod is incompatible. |
| `isTotalConversion` | `bool` | Whether or not the mod should presume conflicts in the absence of dependencies. (default `false`) |
